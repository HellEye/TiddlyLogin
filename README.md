# WIP 

# HTTP Proxy for authenticating and authorizing access to a server via a HTTP header
Made specifically for [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/), due to the built in password authentication system being bad.
Currently frontend only logins a user through password or through a cookie-stored token (probably insecure, temporary solution) and displays the users and wikis from a mongodb database.
